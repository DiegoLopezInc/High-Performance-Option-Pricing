## High-Performance Option Pricing with C++ and GPU Acceleration

### Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing option pricing calculations using C++ and GPU acceleration to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Goals
* Implement high-performance option pricing models in C++.
* Utilize GPU acceleration for significant performance improvements.
* Handle large datasets of option contracts and market data.
* Explore different pricing models (Black-Scholes, Binomial, Monte Carlo).
* Build strong foundation in C++, numerical methods, and parallel computing. 

### Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Collect historical market data and preprocess it for efficient use.
2. **C++ Implementation:** Develop C++ classes for option contracts, pricing models, and data structures.
3. **GPU Acceleration:** Utilize CUDA or OpenCL to offload computationally intensive tasks to the GPU.
4. **Performance Optimization:** Profile the code and identify bottlenecks for optimization.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Compare the performance of different pricing models and GPU acceleration techniques.
